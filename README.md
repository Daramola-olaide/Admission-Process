## Conclusion and Recommendation
 Due to the limited capacity of the university, the 64 applicants with GMAT score between 700-730 shall be considered first while every other applicants shall be placed on waiting list. 
 
 However, applicant that fails to accept and pay the enrolment fee within one week shall forfeit the admission and slot will be taken by the next best applicant in the department.
